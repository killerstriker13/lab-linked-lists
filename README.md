This is my mini-project submission based on the linked list lab.

I found using a dummy node particularly useful. It reduced a lot of code implementation that was required especially in add and remove. Considering that we removed the front field of the list, we also removed a lot of code implementation related to front from remove. I remember in the linked list lab, we had to consider a lot of special cases for inserting and removing nodes from the list, however with the dummy we did not need to consider the empty list or other cases.
